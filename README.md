Personalized Medicine: which is Developing a system that uses genetic information to create personalized treatment plans for patients for example  This could involve researching how different genetic markers affect drug efficacy and side effects i would however want to do this using java 

work in progress 

links for data i would possibly use 

PharmGKB (www.pharmgkb.org) â€“ Contains information on how genetic variation affects drug response.

        Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data) is a machine learning competition and repository which provides public databases about all kinds of things, so I linked their "notebook" on personalized medicine for cancer treatment.
